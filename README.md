# Modeling-Exit-Velocity-MLB-Statcast
This project was with my Senior capstone project. We looked to predict exit velocity or hit speed using MLB Statcast data.

Each data set in this repository represents a different player. We used the top ten players in 2016 according to WAR from baseball reference.

Here are the players:

Brian Dozier, Jose Altuve, Josh Donaldson, Kris Bryant, Kyle Seager, Manny Machado, Mike Trout, Mookie Betts, Nolan Arenado, and Robinson Cano
